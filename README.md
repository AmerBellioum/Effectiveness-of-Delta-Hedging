## An Assessment of the Effectiveness of Daily Delta Hedging w/ Black-Scholes for Writers of European Option Contracts

Market-making financial institution that sell option contracts seek to neutralise their exposure to market movements and instead earn structural revenues (e.g., bid-ask spreads). **Delta-Hedging**, which entails holding the exact amount of shares required to offset changes in the value of the payoff, is a strategy typically employed to reduce directional exposure. However, delta-hedging itself faces multiple sources of error. Most significantly:


## Model Error

The amount of shares held, **Œî**, is computed based on a mathematical model of the option price. Mathematical models are rarely fully representative‚Äîtherefore there is error associated with the difference in how the **MODEL** values the option vs. the **REAL** valuation. For instance, the Black‚ÄìScholes model employed in this circumstance assumes constant volatility of the underlying asset‚Äîwhere in reality, the volatility of the asset may vary significantly with time, leading to a misvaluation of the option **Œî** and hence an erroneous hedge.

## Gamma Error

The delta hedge is rebalanced at **discrete times**. The discrete nature of the rebalancing procedure gives rise to hedging error associated with failure to capture the convexity of the option's value with respect to the underlying price. By employing Taylor Series expansions, the exposure of the portfolio due to the discrete nature of the rebalancing can be seen to be a function of **Œì**, the convexity, in the equation below (see LateX document for full derivation).

## üìÅ Market Data Format Requirements

For the code to work, the market data must be stored specifically as highlighted:

1. A separate '.csv' file for each asset - saved as "{TICKER}_Data.csv" (e.g., `META_Data.csv`, `GOOG_Data.csv`)
2. Each .csv file must contain data sampled at **daily frequency** only. The implementation does not support intraday, weekly, or monthly data.
3. The data must contain only trading days. 
4. The data must have exactly the same format as shown in the sample below. 
5. Files must be stored in a local path.
